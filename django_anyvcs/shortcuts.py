  Render a file to a template, or return the raw contents of the file if it is
  not a text file.

  With `file_mimetype` you can modify the mimetype of the file. The default is
  to detect the mimetype via the path and `mimetypes.guess_type()`. The
  default `encoding` can also be changed. You should catch the encoding errors
  which correspond to your chosen codec.

  `extra_context` may be a dict-like object which are passed into context for
  the template. By default, only `contents`, `rev`, and `path` are passed into
  the template.

  With `textfilter`, you can provide a filter function which modifies the
  decoded text contents of the file. The function must take the file contents,
  the path, and the file's mimetype as its three positional arguments. The
  function is only called if the file is detected to be a text file.

  If `raw` is True, the file will unconditionally be returned in its original
  form.

  If `contents` is given, the contents of the file are not retrieved, and it is
  assumed that `contents` contains the contents of the file.

  If `catch_encoding_errors` is True, encoding errors are handled by returning
  the raw file. Otherwise, you must handle the encoding errors.
